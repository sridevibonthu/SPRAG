PythonQ061,"There are 5 types of literals in Python are : 
1. Boolean
2. Special
3. Strings
4. Numeric 
5. Collection 
1. Boolean :  
    There are two boolean literals : 
      1. True - 1
      2. False - 0
       It gives true for all except the values equal 
        to '0'. 
2. Special : 
     None 
    If there is nothing in the given data. Then it 
      will show 'None'. It has no value.
3. Strings : 
     Eg : '8' , 'string', '9.0' ,etc.
     There are two types : 
      1. Single-line : we use single or double 
           quotes ' ' or '' ''. 
      2. Multi line : we use thrible quotes ""' ""'. 
4 . Numeric : 
     There are three types of numeric literals are 
     1. Integers : 
          All are numbers without fractional part 
     are called integers . 
     Eg : 1, 148, 1744688,etc.
     We use int() to convert any other form to 
     integer form.
     2. Float : 
         All numbers with fractional part are called 
      real numbers , which we refer as float 
      numbers in Python. 
      Eg : 1.0, 8.5, 7.8954,etc.
      We use float( to convert other form into 
      float literals. 
      3. Complex : 
          The numbers which has imaginary part 
       and in the form of a+ib are called complex 
      Collection 
       Eg : 3 + 7j, 5 + 8i, etc. 
4. Collection : 
   There are 4 types of collection literals : 
    1. List : 
      Some elements encolsed in [ ] which are 
      changeable. 
    2. Tuple :
        Some elements enclosed in ( ). Which are 
       non- changeable. 
     3.Set : 
        Some elements enclosed in { }
    4.Dictionary  :
        Elements enclosed in the form of [a:x, b:y]
